# HybridFindR

This repository contains code for the R package HybridFindR. The goal of HybridFindR is to identify loci exhibiting signals of differential introgression.

## Installation

You can install the development version of HybridFindR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kfarleigh/HybridFindR")
```

## Manual 
A complete manual for all documented functions is available [here](insert url) 

## Vignette

A vignette that walks you through differential introgression analysis can be found using:

```r 
library(HybridFindR)
vignette(topic = "Differential_Introgression_Analysis", package = "HybridFindR")
```

There is also an example data file included in the package, which you can load using the command:
```r
data("HybridFindR.data")
```
