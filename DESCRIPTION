Description: Functions to detect signals of differential introgression and investigate individual loci. 
      Takes a structure file as input, uses the R package gghybrid to idenify parental alleles, and then 
      uses a permutation approach to determine if there is a greater proportion of parental alleles 
      coming from one species than is expected by random chance. Also allows one to investigate individual alleles 
      according to missingness and the individuals that are homozygous and heterozygous for each of the parental 
      alleles at a locus.
